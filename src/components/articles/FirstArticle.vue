    <h1>QWC-VENUMM The Basics</h1>
    <p>The Quick Venom stack refers to an application architecture based around nine core technologies;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quasar</li>
      <li>Webpack</li>
      <li>Cordova</li>
      <li>Vue.js</li>
      <li>Express</li>
      <li>Node.js</li>
      <li>Ubuntu Server</li>
      <li>MongoDb</li>
      <li>Mongoose</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each of these will be described in more detail below but before we dive into the specific technologies I want to talk a little bit about the amazing
      functionality that is granted with this application stack. Firstly you can create rock solid and lightweight Single Page Applications easily and quickly thanks to
      templating in both Quasar and Vue. Secondarily thanks to Quasar you can wrap your web application with Cordova to create hybrid web applications that run on both
      IOS and Android. You can also wrap for electron and deploy to desktop computers allowing a true write once run anywhere mentality from one code base with just a
      few simple tweaks. Add in the power of Node.js to provide package managment and you have a simple to learn quality architecture that will allow developers to pool
      there efforts more effectively to produce quality performant software solutions to todays rapidly increasing marketplace. With all these promises you're probably thinking
      "Durban it just cant be so! There is one team for every platform, that must have lag, its gonna be complicated, etc.." while fear not padiwan for once I show you the ease
      of Quick Venom you wont be able to stop coding.
